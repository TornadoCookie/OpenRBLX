OpenRBLX is an open-source recreation of the Roblox engine.

Features:
- rbxmx parsing.
- rbxlx parsing.
- parsing models from the 2005 era with original colour and form.
- parsing modern models as well.
- binary formats (rbxm, rbxl) parsing

TODO:
- 2005 matrices aren't converted from CFrames correctly necessarily yet. we need to test more.
- surfaces
- physics
- 2005 controllers impl (might not have to implement)
- more modern roblox functions as well, such as Humanoids
- more camera functions
- models need to be positioned correctly (bugs in Model_SetModelCFrame)
- 2005 minigame compatibility (might not have to implement)
- lighting
- skybox
- celestial bodies
- studio-like editor
- rccservice + server software
- netcode, httpservice, replication

Testing:
- test_*: test that file format. takes the file as an argument.
