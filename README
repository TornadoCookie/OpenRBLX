OpenRBLX is an open-source recreation of the Roblox engine.

Features:
- rbxmx parsing.
- parsing 2005 models with original colour and form.

TODO:
- matrices aren't converted from CFrames correctly necessarily yet. we need to test more.
- surfaces
- 2005 constraints to SurfaceTypes
- physics
- 2005 controllers impl
- more modern roblox functions as well, such as Humanoids
- more camera functions
- models need to be positioned correctly (bugs in Model_SetModelCFrame)

Testing:
- test_rbxmx: add the .rbxmx file to the datamodel and render it.
- part cframe alignment tests + results in datamodel.c.
